Every now and then you just need a clean slate. So lets start from the top. Hie, my name is Tonderai and I
am a software developer. This new blog is going to document the things I am learning kinda giving you a front
row view for the things that interests me. At the top of the list is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
For those that dont know

> Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance
> and safety, especially safe concurrency.<br>

Now unfortunately, I only get to use rust on side projects and having
played around in the embedded domain. I decided to focus on something a little bit long term and that doesnt encourage
me to buy more and more microcontroller boards. Thanks to [Olivia Ifrim](https://twitter.com/oliviff) my focus is going
to be on building a game. You can follow the [base template Olivia published](https://sokoban.iolivia.me/).

The name of the game is `fight club` and if we do manage to have something function we might even get to play with
other game concepts like two player setups or even online two play type setup.
