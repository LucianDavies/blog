Hi, my name is Tonderai Khatai. I work at [On](https://www.on-running.com/en-de/) where we are revolutionizing the sensation of running. I hold a TechLead role for one of the engineering teams that actively facilitates product movements to, from and between warehouses around the globe. Weâ€™re here to go on a journey on the ins and outs of the various forms of software engineering communication. We are going to cover communication styles, communication mediums, communication content, etc. The goal is that by the end of this journey, each of you will have the skills you need to better convey solutions, seek information efficiently and most importantly a skill you need to build your personal brand.
